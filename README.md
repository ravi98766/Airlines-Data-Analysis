**_Business Problem**

Our company has been providing high-quality air transportation service to our clients for several years, ensuring a safe, comfortable, and convenient journey for our passengers. We operate a diverse fleet of aircraft, ranging from small business jets to medium-sized machines. However, we currently face challenges due to various factors such as stricter environmental regulations, higher flight taxes, increased interest rates, rising fuel prices, and a tight labor market leading to higher labor costs. These challenges are putting pressure on the company's profitability, and we are actively seeking solutions to address this issue. In order to tackle this challenge, the company is planning to analyze their database and identify opportunities to increase the occupancy rate, thereby boosting the average profit earned per seat.

**Key Obstacles**

•	Stricter environmental regulations: The airlines industry is facing increasing pressure to reduce its carbon footprint, leading to the implementation of more stringent environmental laws. These regulations not only raise operating costs but also restrict the potential for expansion.

•	Higher flight taxes: Governments worldwide are imposing heavier taxes on aircraft as a means to address environmental concerns and generate revenue. This increase in flight taxes has raised the overall cost of flying, subsequently reducing demand.

•	Tight labor market resulting in increased labor costs: The aviation sector is experiencing a scarcity of skilled
workers, leading to higher labor costs and an increase in turnover rates
 
**Q1) How many planes have more than 100 seats?**

In this analysis we have findings of

•	The number of planes with more than 100 seats

•	How the number of tickets booked and total amount earned overtime

•	Average fare with each aircraft with different fare conditions



The Screenshot attached reveals the aircraft with more
than 100 seats and actual count of seats.<img width="748" height="695" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cabe6818-2f5c-4d7f-a161-77dd8167e7e0" />

 
**Q2)How the number of tickets booked and total amount earned changed with the time**?

Upon analysis we have plotted line chart that reveals—

•	The line plot with **blue line** shows a gradual increase from 22nd July to 7th July, following a relatively stable pattern from 8th July to august with an observed peak having the highest number of tickets booked	in a single day whatever be the reason.

•	The Pot with **red line** shows Revenue earned by company and is closely tied with the number of tickets sold/booked. Therefore we Can see the similar trend in the total revenue earned by the company throughout the analyzed period of time.

•	FINALLY, We can conclude that the factor resulting the peak in tickets booked may be beneficial in increasing the overall revenue of the company and optimizing the airline performance.
 
**Q3)Calculate the average charges for each aircraft with different fare conditions**

RESULTS:

After computing the Average of costs associated with different fare conditions for each aircraft we have plotted a bar graph to depict the results.

•	Three types of fare – Business, Comfort and Economy.

•	CN1 and CR2 only provide economy class while comfort class is available only in aircraft 773.

•	When different Pricing Circumstances within each aircraft are compared the charges for business class are consistently greater than those for economy class. This trend may be seen across different planes regardless of fare conditions.

**Q4) For each aircraft, calculate the total revenue per year and the average revenue per ticket**

•	Aircraft with higher total Revenue is SU9 and it can be seen that price of the Business and economy class is lower in this aircraft. This could be reason why people has preferred to buy this aircraft tickets and thereby increasing its revenue.

•	CN1 is the aircraft with least total revenue and the possible reason could be its poor facilities, less facilities instead of offering the economy class with very less prices.

•	FINALLY, Airlines must analyze their revenue streams in order to maximize their profitability.
 
**Q5)Calculate the average occupancy per aircraft**

<img width="676" height="625" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22e460aa-3a93-49f2-ab7b-20f7093cb4e5" />


•	The Average Occupancy rate per aircraft is another crucial point to consider. Airlines must measure – how they are filling their seats, discover new channels to attract new customers and boost their occupancy rates. Higher occupancy rates can help airlines to increase their Revenue and Profitability while lowering their operational cost associated with vacant seats.

•	The screenshot shows Average seat booked fromtotal number of seats for each aircraft.

•	Occupancy rate is calculated by dividing the booked seats by the total number of seats. Higher occupancy rates means aircraft seats ae more booked and only few of them are left unbooked.
 
**Q6) Calculate by how much the total annual turnover could increase by giving all aircraft a 10% higher occupancy rate?**

<img width="802" height="296" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4faff8dd-6f83-42a0-8ab8-c64f5de5e851" />

•	Airlines may enhance occupancy rates and Revenue while delivering the greater value and service to customers by optimizing the pricing tactics and other operational activities.

•	The screenshot shows increasing 10% occupancy rates will gradually increase their yearly revenue so the airlines must be focused on their pricing strategies.
